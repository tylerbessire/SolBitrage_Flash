## Security Considerations

- **Private Keys**: Never share your wallet's private key

- **Testnet First**: Always test thoroughly on testnet before mainnet deployment
- **Risk Management**: Use the built-in risk management features

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Errors**:
   - Verify your internet connection
   - Check that the RPC URL is correct and accessible
   - Ensure you have sufficient SOL for transaction fees

2. **Transaction Failures**:
   - Check for sufficient funds in your wallet
   - Verify slippage tolerance settings
   - Ensure the RPC node is responsive

3. **Performance Issues**:
   - Increase server resources if running on a VPS
   - Optimize token pair selection
   - Adjust update interval settings
